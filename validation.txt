Questions:
- how is <name> defined?
- how is <task-symbol> defined?
- what are valid instances of <require-key>?
- how does <variable> ::= ?<name> work? Why is it like this?
- will a term ever be a variable, considering we always hit the rule for <name> first?

Validations:
- all tasks in ordering-def are actually defined in the method
- the ordering-defs do not form a cycle
- optional features are only used when the corresponding require-key is set
